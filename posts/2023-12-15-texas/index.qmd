# Texas Blackouts

## ***Question: How did socioeconomic factors influence community recovery from 2021 power outages in Houston, Texas?***

repo link \| https://github.com/Vanessa-Salgado/houston-blackout-lights-analysis

### Background

In February 2021, severe winter storms in the United States caused a major power outage in the state of Texas. The loss of power resulted in over 4.5 million homes and businesses left without power, and several deaths. This analysis uses remotely sensed night light data to assess the impact and distribution of these blackouts. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau will be added to investigate if socioeconomic factors affect the recovery of power within the community.

### Project objectives and methods

In this analysis, I will be: - estimating the number of homes in Houston that lost power as a result of the first two storms\
- investigating if socioeconomic factors are predictors of communities recovery from a power outage

This analysis will rely on remotely-sensed night lights data acquired from the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_Infrared_Imaging_Radiometer_Suite) aboard the Suomi satellite. Specifically, we will use the VNP46A1 to identify variations in night lights before and after the storms as a method to identify areas that lost electrical power.

## Data

#### Night lights

We use NASA's Worldview to explore the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.

VIIRS data is distributed through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.

#### Roads `gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg`

Typically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, we will ignore areas near highways.

[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world. We used [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/) to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area. 

#### Houses `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg`

We also obtain building data from OpenStreetMap. We again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.

#### Socioeconomic`ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb`

We cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019. The *folder* `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb` is an ArcGIS ["file geodatabase"](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/file-geodatabases.htm), a multi-file proprietary format that's roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file. We can use `st_layers()` to explore the contents of the geodatabase. Each layer contains a subset of the fields documents in the [ACS metadata](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/tiger/prejoined/ACSMetadata2011.txt). The geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information, separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes. You have to combine the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that `sf` can use.

## Outline and Plan of Analysis

Below is an outline of the steps taken to achieve the objectives.

1\) Find locations of blackouts

2\) Find homes impacted by blackouts

3\) Investigate Socioeconomic Factors

4\) Leverage the results for a summary and discussion

## Importing necessary libraries and functions

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(stars)
library(tmap)
library(raster)
library(terra)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
```

## Find locations of blackouts

For improved computational efficiency and easier inter-operability with `sf`, we use the `stars` package for raster handling.

##### [Combining the data]{.underline}

We first read in night lights tiles, then combine tiles into a single `stars` object for each date (2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16) using `st_mosaic.`

The following files had been subsetted & stored in the `VNP46A1` folder.

-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-07
-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-07
-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-16
-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-16

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, include = FALSE}
## Read in all four night lights tiles, in folder VNP46A1, using the package "stars" 

tile1_2021_02_07 = read_stars(here("data", "VNP46A1", "VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif"))
 
tile2_2021_02_07 = read_stars(here("data", "VNP46A1", "VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif"))

tile3_2021_02_16 =  read_stars(here("data", "VNP46A1","VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif"))

tile4_2021_02_16 =  read_stars(here("data","VNP46A1","VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif"))


# combine tiles into single stars object for each date (2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16), using st_mosaic 
combined_02_07 = st_mosaic(tile1_2021_02_07, tile2_2021_02_07)
combined_02_16 = st_mosaic(tile3_2021_02_16, tile4_2021_02_16)

```

##### [Creating a blackout mask]{.underline}

We then find the change in night lights intensity (presumably) caused by the storm, and reclassify the difference raster, assuming that any location that experienced a drop of more than 200 nW cm^-2^sr^-1^ experienced a blackout. Then we assign `NA` to all locations that experienced a drop of *less* than 200 nW cm^-2^sr.^-1^\

```{r}
#find the change in night lights intensity (presumably) caused by the storm by calculating the light difference between the two dates 
difference <- combined_02_07 - combined_02_16


#check out difference in night lights intensity 
plot(difference)

```

Assigning all the houses that experienced a drop of 200 and more to a blackout mask.

```{r results = FALSE}
mask_blackout <- difference > 200 
mask_blackout[mask_blackout == FALSE]  <- NA
```

##### [Vectorize the mask]{.underline}

We use `st_as_sf()` to vectorize the blackout mask and fix any invalid geometries using `st_make_valid.`

```{r results = FALSE}

blackout_mask_vector <- st_as_sf(mask_blackout) %>% st_make_valid() ##can plot() to check out what the blackout mask looks like 

```

##### [Cropping the vectorized map to our region of interest]{.underline}

-   We first define the Houston metropolitan area with the following coordinates : (-96.5, 29), (-96.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 30.5), (-94.5, 29) and then turn these coordinates into a polygon using `st_polygon.`
-   Then we convert the polygon into a simple feature collection using `st_sfc()` and assign a CRS, making sure that the polygon is in the same CRS and crop (spatially subset) the blackout mask to our region of interest. Lastly we re-project the cropped blackout dataset to EPSG:3083 (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area).\

```{r include=TRUE}

#crop the vectorized map to our region of interest using polygon of Houston's coordinates 
houston_polygon <- st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-96.5,29), c(-96.5,30.5), c(-94.5, 30.5), c(-94.5,29), c(-96.5,29))))


#convert the polygon into a simple feature collection using st_sfc() and assign the CRS 4326, which is the same as the night lights data
houston_border_sf <- st_sfc(houston_polygon, crs = st_crs(mask_blackout))


#inspect the polygon crs to make sure the crs is 4326, nightlights dataset
#st_crs(houston_border_sf) == st_crs(mask_blackout)

```

Spatially subsetting blackout mask to Houston region, then reprojecting to the correct CRS.

```{r include = FALSE}

# spatially subset the blackout mask to the Houston Area
houston_blackout <- blackout_mask_vector[houston_border_sf, ,]


#re-project the cropped blackout dataset to EPSG:3083 (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area)
houston_blackout <- st_transform(houston_blackout, crs = 'EPSG:3083')

## transform to sf object
final_houston_blackout <- st_as_sf(houston_blackout)

#verify that it's an sf object 
#class(final_houston_blackout)

##verify that the final, transformed sf houston blackout dataset is 3083 
#st_crs(final_houston_blackout) 
```

##### [Excluding highways from blackout mask]{.underline}

The roads geopackage includes data on roads other than highways. However, we can avoid reading in data we don't need by taking advantage of `st_read`'s ability to subset using a SQL query. First, we load just highway data from geopackage using `st_read and`reproject data to EPSG:3083, identifying areas within 200m of all highways using `st_buffer. st_buffer` produces undissolved buffers, so we use `st_union` to dissolve them. Then we find areas that experienced blackouts that are further than 200m from a highway.

[Read in highway data from roads using SQL query]{.underline} :

`query <- "SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'"`\
`highways <- st_read("data/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg", query = query)`

```{r results = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
query <- "SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'"
highways <- st_read(here("data/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg"), query = query)
```

Then reproject and subset using st_difference()

```{r include=TRUE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

# reproject data to EPSG:3083 
highways_3038 <- st_transform(highways, crs="EPSG:3083")

#verify it's the right crs
#st_crs(highways_3038)

# identify areas within 200m of all highways using st_buffer. Use st_union to dissolve overlapping polygons. 
a_near_hwys <- st_buffer(highways_3038, dist = 200) %>% st_union()

# find areas that experienced blackouts that are further than 200m from a highway by spacially subsetting houston blackout areas to ones near highways, and taking st_difference of that. 
blackouts_far_hwy_houston <- final_houston_blackout[a_near_hwys, , op = st_difference] 


#plot to see what it looks like 
#plot(blackouts_far_hwy_houston)
```

## Finding homes impacted by blackouts

##### [Load buildings data]{.underline}

We load buildings dataset using `st_read` and the following SQL query to select only residential buildings. We first reproject data to EPSG:3083.

The SQL query we will use is:

`SELECT *`  `FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1`\
`WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)`\
`OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')`\

```{r results=FALSE, include=TRUE}

#load buildings dataset using st_read and the following SQL query to select only residential buildings

query_buildings <- "SELECT * FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL) OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')"

buildings <- st_read(here("data","gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg"), query = query_buildings)
```

##### [finding homes in blackout areas]{.underline}

We filter to homes within blackout areas, then we count number of impacted homes. First, checking for CRS compatibility. Since they aren't, we need to transform and then subset.

```{r include=TRUE}
##check CRS's are the same. No, they're not!
#st_crs(buildings) == st_crs(blackouts_far_hwy_houston)

##transform buildings crs 
buildings <- st_transform(buildings, crs = st_crs(blackouts_far_hwy_houston))

# filtering the houses data with the blackout mask
buildings_blackout <- buildings[blackouts_far_hwy_houston, drop = FALSE]

## View the data frame for inspection 
#View(buildings_blackout)

#count number of impacted homes
print(paste0(nrow(buildings_blackout), " Houston homes experienced power outage due to the Texas storms in Feburary, 2021"))

```

## Investigate socioeconomic factors

##### [load ACS data]{.underline}

To set up for loading, we use `st_read()` to load the geodatabase layers and geometries are stored in the `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS` layer. The income data is stored in the `X19_INCOME` layer, so we select the median income field `B19013e1 and`reproject data to EPSG:3083.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include = FALSE}

census <- st_read(here("data","ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb"),  layer = "ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS")

income <- st_read(here("data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb"), layer = "X19_INCOME")

#select median income field B19013e1
median_income <- income %>% dplyr::select(GEOID, B19013e1) 
```

##### [Determine which census tracts experienced blackouts]{.underline}

We join the income data to the census tract geometries by joining by geometry ID and spatially join census tract data with buildings determined to be impacted by blackouts, then find which census tracts had blackouts.\

```{r include=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

#determine which census tracts experienced blackouts 
#Join the income data to the census tract geometries. Join by geometry ID
median_income_df <- median_income %>% rename(GEOID_Data = GEOID,
         median_income = B19013e1) 


##check types to varify that they are the same class 
#class(median_income_df$GEOID_Data) == class(census$GEOID_Data)

joined_income_census <- left_join(census, 
                         median_income_df, 
                         by = "GEOID_Data")


## filter census data by buildings determined to be impacted by blackouts. 

# transforming both objects to the correct crs
joined_income_census <- st_transform(joined_income_census, crs = st_crs(census))
buildings_blackout <- st_transform(buildings_blackout, crs = st_crs(census))

#check that they are the same crs 
#st_crs(joined_income_census) == st_crs(buildings_blackout)

## filtering and mutating to add a blackout column for affected tracts 
census_blackout <- joined_income_census[buildings_blackout,]%>% mutate(blackout = 'Y')

print(paste0(nrow(census_blackout), " census tracts had blackouts"))




```

Since we have blackout status of Y indicated, we will want to indicate "N" for no-blackout areas as well, for full dataset.

```{r include = FALSE}
#census_income_cropped combined with census_blackout
census_Y_N <- full_join(as.data.frame(joined_income_census), as.data.frame(census_blackout))
census_Y_N$blackout[is.na(census_Y_N$blackout)] = "N" 

#check the class 
#class(census_Y_N)


## make sure it's an sf object 
census_Y_N <- st_as_sf(census_Y_N)

#check census_Y_N class, that it's a dataframe. 
#class(census_Y_N)

```

##### [Comparing incomes of impacted tracts to unimpacted tracts]{.underline}

To do this, we create a map using tmap of median income by census tract, designating which tracts had blackouts. We then plot the distribution of income in impacted and unimpacted tracts.

**I included the code for the map here, although the map does not render. I've attached a screeshot**

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#join income data to the census tract geometries and crop to region of interest
census_income_geom <- left_join(census, median_income_df, 
                         by = "GEOID_Data") %>% st_transform(3083) #this is texas#
houston_border_sf <- houston_border_sf %>% st_transform(3083)


#spatial crop joined census data to houston border 
census_income_geom_cropped <- census_income_geom[houston_border_sf, op = st_intersects] 


## use tmap to plot income distribution and affected areas. Make graph aesthetics. 
# tmap_mode("plot")
# tm_shape(census_income_geom_cropped) + 
#   tm_graticules() + 
#   tm_polygons("median_income", palette= "-viridis", title = "Median Income") + 
#   tm_shape(census_blackout) + tm_dots(size = 0.4, alpha = 0.5) + 
#   tm_title( "Blackout Status & Median Income by Census in Houston (Feb 16,2021)") +
#   tm_scalebar(position = c("RIGHT", "BOTTOM")) + 
#   tm_compass(position = c("LEFT", "TOP")) + 
#   tm_xlab("Longitude", size = 0.5) + 
#   tm_ylab("Latitude", rotation = 90, size = 0.5) 

```

![](houston_blackout.png)

# **Evaluate the distribution of median incomes of homes by blackout status**

Included some summary statistics first.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
### Summarizing statistics 
census_Y_N_houston <- census_Y_N %>% st_transform(3083) 
houston_border_sf <- houston_border_sf %>% st_transform(3083)
census_Y_N_houston <- census_Y_N_houston[houston_border_sf, op = st_intersects] 

census_Y_N_houston %>% 
  group_by(blackout) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(median_income, na.rm = TRUE),
            median = median(median_income, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(median_income, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Plot a histogram of median income for blackout or non-blackout regions.

```{r}

ggplot(census_Y_N_houston, aes(median_income))+geom_histogram(aes(color = blackout, fill = blackout), bins = 50, fill = "white") + ggtitle("Distribution of median income of homes in Houston by blackout status") 
```

## Discussion

We found that 778 census tracts had been affected by Texas's 2021 energy crisis, amounting to 164,867 total homes experiencing power outage between the studied dates (Feb 07, 2021 to Feb 16, 2021).

The average median income for homes that experienced a blackout was \$70,939, slightly higher than the average median income for homes that didn't experience a blackout, which was \$67,859. It is important to note that 1) our factor of interest was median income within census tracts and that other socioeconomic factors could reveal unexplored spatial patterns, and that 2) weather conditions were not normalized to conduct this exercise, variable that could cause a different outcome.
